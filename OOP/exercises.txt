We create an object by replacing the def keyword for methods with class
classes are named using CamelCase. We conclude the definition with the end keyword. Methods and instance variables for the class go in between (before the end keyworld.)

class Person
end

module Speak

def speak(sound)
  puts "#{sound}"
end
