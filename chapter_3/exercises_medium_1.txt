Question 1
  answer: 10.times {|n| puts "The Flintstones Rock!".insert(0, (' ' * n)) }
Question 2
  answer: statement = "The Flintstones Rock"
          hash = {}
          statement.each_char do |char|
            hash[char] = statement.delete(' ').scan(char).count
          end
          hash.delete ' '
Question 3
  answer: (40+2) is an integer and can't be directly added to string
          puts "the value of 40 + 2 is " + (40 + 2).to_s  cast to string
          OR
          puts "the value of 40 + 2 is #{(40 + 2)}" interpolation
Question 4
  answer: 1,3 & 1,2
Question 5
answer: def factors(number)
          dividend = number
          divisors = []
          while dividend > 0 do
            divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
            dividend -= 1
          end
          divisors
        end
        Bonus 1: number % dividend checks to make sure number can be divided by dividend evenly which is what makes it a factor.
        Bonus 2: the last line makes divisors the return value of factors method.
Question 6
answer: rolling_buffer1 will modify the array that was passed in.
        rolling_buffer2 will not modify the array
Question 7
answer: methods don't have access to variables that are not local to the method. Can fix by defining limit right before while loop, or include as a parameter to fib method.
Question 8
answer: def titleize!(string)
        string_array = string.split(' ')
        string_array.each { |word| word.capitalize!}.join ' '
end
Question 9
answer:  hash = munsters.each do |key, value|
           case value['age']
           when 0..18 then value['age group'] = 'kid'
           when 18..65 then value['age group'] = 'adult'
           else
             value['age group'] = 'senior'
           end
         end
